<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that you&rsquo;ve found your way to this page, as there really isn&rsquo;t a lot to say about me.  I live a boring life
in the small town of Denton, NE (current population 189), which is approximately 15 miles away from the center of the
thriving medium-sized metropolis that is Lincoln, NE (born and raised).  I am a veteran of the United States Air Force,
a husband, and a fur-daddy of a spoiled rotten Norwegian Elkhound named Lana.</p>
<p><img src="/img/lana.png" alt="Lana"></p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not at work, I love spending time with my family, cheering on all Nebraska sports (Go Big Red), working on cars (ex-auto
technician prior to my IT career), playing all types of sports (volleyball and golf currently), or writing code.</p>
<h1 id="professional-life">Professional Life</h1>
<p>I am passionate about all things IT.  My background started in Networking/Linux in the US Air Force and very rapidly evolved into the
management and cloud automation space.  My post-military career included several contracting/sub-contracting gigs with the DoD.  Following
that, I spent five years as an Architect and Managing Architect at Red Hat in this space and decided that I was interested in
seeing the next big thing, which is now Kubernetes.  I worked with some of the most talented people on the planet in the Kubernetes
space at VMware for 3 years and focused on the Tanzu platform as well as building backend services on Amazon EKS.  I have since
returned to Red Hat in a technical sales role called a Managed OpenShift Black Belt where I focus my time an efforts in supporting
Managed OpenShift services such as ROSA and ARO.</p>
